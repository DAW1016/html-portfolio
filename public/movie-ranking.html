<h3>Spiderman</h3>

<p>I like Spiderman movies because He can shoot webs and He can climb on building and stick to things.</p>

<h3>Larva</h3>

<p>I like the Larva movie because the are funny and fart a lot. They do fun things and they fight with each other then make up.</p>

<h3>Mario Brothers</h3>

<p>I like the Mario brothers movie because they try to go to the castle and save the princess from Bowzer</p>

<h3>Home Alone</h3>

<p>I like the Home Alone movie because robbers come to the house and 8 year old boy named Kevin beat them up and saved his families home. He enjoyed being home alone once He got use to it.</p>
